# Obsidian Knowledge System

This vault is organized to support:
- Client work
- Ongoing company operations
- Development knowledge
- Reusable AI prompts

Design principles:
- One vault
- Clients contain projects
- Development knowledge is global
- Prompts are reusable and never duplicated
- One concept per note
- Link instead of copy

This structure is optimized for AI-assisted work using Claude + MCP.
